# AI-Based E-Waste Identification Using Camera Input

## Module
M516 – Business Project in Big Data & AI

## Project Overview
Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest growing waste streams worldwide, yet recycling rates remain low due to limited automation in waste identification and sorting processes.

This project presents a proof-of-concept AI system that uses computer vision to identify types of e-waste from camera input. The system is designed to run locally and demonstrates how image classification models can support sustainability-focused decision making in recycling and waste management contexts.

The project focuses on feasibility, interpretability, and reproducibility rather than production-scale deployment.

## Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:

1. To analyse and understand publicly available e-waste image datasets.
2. To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess data quality and suitability.
3. To train and evaluate an image classification model for e-waste identification.
4. To deploy the trained model locally and demonstrate real-time inference using a webcam.
5. To critically evaluate the model’s performance and limitations in a sustainability context.
